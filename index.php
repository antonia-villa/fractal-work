                <h2>Statement</h2>
                <p>By day a data analyst and by night an artist, I am a Boston based artist navigating the undefined space between the analytical and creative worlds. With a background in mathematics and abstract digital photography, I work with the process of decalcomania (transferring a design from one surface to another) forming black and white prints of mathematical fractals.</p>

                <p>My work aims to create a bridge between the visual world and quantitative world through the use of fractals. Mathematical theorems intertwine with the visual world effortlessly on an endless basis, however merging and relating the two through art is a much more challenging effort. Too often, the dividing barrier between mathematics and society is enforced by intimidation, a perceived over-complexity, and a reliance on numerical units. By presenting math in a visual context, each viewer is offered a unique experience allowing his or her imagination to wander through the texture and contours of my work.  </p>
