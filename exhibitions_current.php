                <h3>47 Winchester Street</h3>
                <h4>October 2016 - present</h4>
                <p>47 Winchester is a hybrid AirBNB and recreation space in the heart of the historic Bay Village area in downtown Boston. This 4-story brownstone was renovated, designed and managed by Michael Winston & Nicole Fichera principals of FWD Partners. They brought me in to curate the space with art works that are available for purchase to the guests, creating yet another layer to this multi-functional property.
